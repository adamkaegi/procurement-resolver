# Decision Log

## Phase 0: deterministic validation

- Context: The archived pilot is already published as OCDS JSON.
- Decision: Validate the compiled releases with a local JSON Schema and no model call.
- Alternative rejected: LLM-based schema inference.
- Consequence: The acceptance test is reproducible and schema failures are attributable to the subset.

## Phase 1: deterministic mapping application

- Context: Phase 1 requires calibration mappings before automation.
- Decision: Hand-written YAML mappings and deterministic Python transforms; no LLM calls.
- Alternative rejected: generating mappings with an LLM before gold sets exist.
- Consequence: Mapping behavior is reviewable and provides the baseline for Phase 2 human labels.
