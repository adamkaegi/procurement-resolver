# Progress

## Phase 0

- Acceptance test: fetched the official archived CanadaBuys OCDS pilot records ZIP and validated every English `compiledRelease` against `schema/ocds_subset.json`.
- Result: passed for 250 releases.
- Decision: the pilot's outer package envelope is not the canonical record; validation targets `records[*].compiledRelease`.
- Uncertainty: the subset intentionally permits additional OCDS fields because the pilot contains publisher, tender, planning, and document fields outside the project subset.
- Human verification before Phase 1: confirm the deliberate permissiveness of `additionalProperties` remains appropriate when manual adapters are reviewed.
